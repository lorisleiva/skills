- NEVER commit, push, create branches, or create PRs without explicit user approval.
- Before any git operation that creates or modifies a commit, present a review block containing: changeset content (if applicable), commit title, and commit/PR description. ALWAYS wait for approval.
- Use standard `git add` and `git commit` workflows. Concise title on the first line, blank line, then description body.
- Use `gh pr create` for pull requests. Start PR descriptions with "This PR...".
