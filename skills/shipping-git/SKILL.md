# Ship Code Using Git

Guidance for shipping code using standard Git and the GitHub CLI (`gh`). This skill teaches the agent how to create commits, branches, and pull requests following conventional workflows.

## Key Rules

- NEVER commit, push, create branches, or create PRs without explicit user approval.
- Before any git operation that creates or modifies a commit, present a review block containing: changeset content (if applicable), commit title, and commit/PR description. ALWAYS wait for approval.
- Show the proposed changeset entry for review before writing the changeset file.
- Use standard `git add` and `git commit` workflows. Concise title on the first line, blank line, then description body.
- Use `gh pr create` for pull requests.

## Guidelines

### Creating Commits

Follow conventional commit message format:

```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "Commit title" -m "Description body explaining what changed and why."
```

- The first `-m` sets the commit title (first line). Keep it concise and descriptive.
- The second `-m` sets the commit body. Explain what changed and why.
- Use present tense, imperative mood (e.g. "Add feature" not "Added feature").

### Creating Branches

Create a descriptive branch name before committing:

```sh
git checkout -b feature/short-description
```

Common prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `chore/`.

### Creating Pull Requests

Use the GitHub CLI to create PRs:

```sh
gh pr create --title "PR title" --body "Description explaining what changed and why."
```

- If a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` exists, use it as a guide for structuring the PR description. Fill in sections that are relevant and omit sections that don't apply (e.g. don't add "Fixes #" if there's no related issue).

### Pushing Changes

Push the branch and set the upstream:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### Review Block Format

Before any git operation, present this review block and wait for approval:

1. **Changeset entry** (if applicable) — the proposed changelog entry and bump type.
2. **Commit title** — a concise title for the commit.
3. **Commit/PR description** — a short description that explains what changed and why.
