- NEVER commit, push, create branches, or create PRs without explicit user approval.
- Before any git operation that creates or modifies a commit, present a **review block** containing:
    1. **Changeset content** (if applicable) — the full changeset file contents.
    2. **Commit title** — a concise title for the commit.
    3. **Commit/PR description** — a short description explaining what changed and why.
- ALWAYS wait for the user to approve or request changes before proceeding.
- This applies to all commit, branch, PR, and changeset operations.
