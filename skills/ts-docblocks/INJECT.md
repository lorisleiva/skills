heading: TypeScript Docblocks
---

- All exported functions, types, interfaces, and constants must have JSDoc docblocks.
- Start with `/**`, use `*` prefix for each line, end with `*/` — each on its own line.
- Begin with a clear one-to-two line summary. Add a blank line before tags.
- Include `@param`, `@typeParam`, `@return`, `@throws`, and at least one `@example` when helpful.
- Use `{@link ...}` to reference related items. Add `@see` tags at the end for related APIs.
