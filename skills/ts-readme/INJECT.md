heading: TypeScript READMEs

- When adding a new public API, add or update the package's README.
- Structure: brief intro, installation, usage (with code snippet), deep-dive sections.
- Code snippets must be realistic, concise, and use TypeScript syntax.
- Focus on the quickest path to success. Developers should feel excited, not overwhelmed.
